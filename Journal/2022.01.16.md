The stock keyboard/trackpad cover just don't work well for me.
I've found that putting the tablet portion in a "traditional" flip cover with tri-fold cover to stand works best for my work flow.
The majority of the time I'm using the Duet in a tablet mode.  This works well with touch or stylus.
When I do want to use the Duet for coding/writing I find that an external keyboard like the Logitech Keys 2 Go or the Logitech K810 are great options.
I am tempted to try a bluetooth thinkpad keyboard/trackpoint combo with it.

The other option I am considering is upgrading to a Thinkpad C13 Yoga Chromebook.
Considering this because of the larger screen and nice keyboard.
Also, because, for the most part, the ChromeOS with Android and Linux Apps experience has been good.
