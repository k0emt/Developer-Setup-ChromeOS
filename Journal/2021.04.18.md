# 2021.04.18

- Updated VS Code from Linux command line.
- Installed gatsby.  
  - Played with the hello-world app (`gatsby develop`)
  - Ran gatsby develop and was able to browse to it with `http://localhost:8000`
  - Was able to browse to the gatsby GraphQL interface at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`
- Attempted to install the Insomnia REST/GraphQL app from debian package.  No go.
- Installed Altair GraphQL client for Chrome.
- Terminal app crashed on me when I left it running `gatsby develop` and walked away for a bit.  And I haven't been able to browse the gatsby site in the browser again.  Rebooting the duet and restarting everything, it worked again.
