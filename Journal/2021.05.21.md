I am finding the Duet to be quite usable.  Chrome OS is up to date at: `Version 90.0.4430.218 (Official Build) (32-bit)`.  I have noticed a slight amount of lag at times.  It may be because I have a number of tabs open and have added some more extensions to Chrome.  In any case, as I write this, the system seems responsive.

The coo mouse is tolerable.  But, I find myself yearning for a Logitech Anywhere MX mouse.

I am finding that the Duet makes for a nice quick access development laptop.  Caveats, I wouldn't want to work on it all day.  Primarily, because of the screen size and keyboard.  Although, the Duet does support multiple external monitors.  And I could easily swap in a full size bluetooth keyboard.

I iniatiated another node project on the Duet last night.  Pushed to GitHub and then picked up work at my office computer.  This entry (and this commit) are being created on the Duet.

Next thing to figure out is the best approach to update Microsoft VS Code.
