## VIC Emulator

Installing the VICE-3.5 VIC Emulator.
Mostly following the instructions in this
[build guide](https://techwithdave.davevw.com/2021/01/how-to-build-vice-35-x64sc-etc-on.html).  With the exception of needing a few more items installed.

```bash
sudo apt install -y gcc g++ flex bison dos2unix xa65 texinfo texlive
sudo apt install -y libgtk2.0-dev libxxf86vm-dev libpulse-dev libasound2-dev
sudo apt install -y texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-extra
```

After a lot of time managed to get the project compiled and built.  However, I've been unsuccesful in getting it to run. :-/

## Stylus

I picked up a [Penoval USSI stylus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L8XZNFN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to use with the Duet.
Overall, I feel like it is a fairly good experience.
