I've been keeping an eye out on devices that are available on the market and still find the Duet to be the best value for the features.

## Chrome OS quirkiness

With the Duet when the keyboard is attached it operates in laptop mode.
When the keyboard is detached, it transitions to a tablet mode.
For me, that means the dock moves from the left side of the screen to the bottom.
When in tablet mode a desktop switcher is added to the navbar.
Otherwise, in keyboard mode use the key above the 6 key to switch.

Where things get a little weird is when you bring a bluetooth mouse into the mix.
If you are using the mouse then Chrome OS keeps you in the laptop mode even if you disconnect the keyboard.

## eReading

I've been using the Duet to do some eReading with Chrome and the Kindle app.
There was some weirdness in getting the continuous scrolling feature of the Kindle app enabled.
That feature in combination with the subtle green background make for sublime reading.
