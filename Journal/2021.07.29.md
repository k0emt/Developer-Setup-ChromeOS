## VIC Emulator part deux

Some more system work towards getting vice working.

Updated `/etc/apt/sources.list` to include contrib for buster.

```

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vice
sudo apt install python-opencv
```

Used information from [this page](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/c64-vice-emulator-fails-to-load-kernal-on-ubuntu-system-566043/) to locate ROMs and copy them into the correct location at `~/.vice`  After, system restart, I had to copy the ROM files from `.vice` to `/usr/lib/vice/C64`.

The VIC emulators show up in the Linux Apps section of the launcher now.
However, they aren't running.  When I go to the command line and run `x64` it does open.  But, with a simple `POKE 646,6` it crashes.  I'm noticing some visual glitching in VS Code now.

Feeling alot like rolling it all back.
