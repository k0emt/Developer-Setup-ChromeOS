I am to the point now where I am using the duet with VS Code, git, etc to work on this repo.  

I did get the basic hello world docker container running.

For [the picture](lenovo-duet-scaled.webp) in the [README.md](README.md), I took it with an iPhone (heic).  Uploaded it to OneDrive.  Downloaded it to the duet.  Used a web tool to convert it to webp format.  Then used the file browser to move it to the Linux files folder.  I should probably add Google Drive to my iPhone so I can shortcut a bit.

Installed the AWS CLI.  Verified operation.
