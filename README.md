# Developer Setup ChromeOS

Setting up a Lenovo Duet ChromeOS tablet for developer use.

## Background

I haven't owned an Android device in some time.
I've never owned a ChromeOS device.
However, with the advent of the Linux(Beta) feature and coming across a Lenovo Duet on sale, it was time to explore this.
Also, I've always been a fan of small devices and seeing what they can be pushed to do.  For example, I'm initiating this repo on an iPad mini with Bluetooth keyboard.

### Why the Lenovo Duet?

- A contributing factor was that I found it on sale for $250.
- I have in general been happy with other Lenovo products I've owned.
- Machine specs
  - 4G RAM
  - 128G Storage
  - 8 core processor
  - 1080P+ display
  - Included keyboard
  - USI stylus support (I'm a long time tablet/stylus user)
